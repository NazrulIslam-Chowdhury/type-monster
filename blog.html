                    <strong>Local storage: 1.</strong>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.
                    <strong>2.</strong>As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually.
                    <strong>3.</strong>The client can only read local storage.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Session storage: 1.</strong>The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB.
                    <strong>2.</strong>Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored
                    only for the duration of a session, until the browser (or tab) is closed. <strong>3.</strong>The
                    client can only read local storage.

                    question 2:Difference between global scope and block scope.

                <strong>Global scope:</strong>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared
                outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be
                accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.
                <br>
                <strong>Block scope:</strong>The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the
                block statements, don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will
                not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.ES6 introduced block scope by
                using the let and const keywords. These two keywords are scoped within the block which are defined.

                    JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                    collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
                    models in other languages like C and Java.
